                JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented
                by
                Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games,
                animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools
                on
                top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These
                include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality
                    such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream
                    from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content
                    providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building
                    sites and applications.

            <header>
                A Hello world! example
            </header>
            <p>
                Getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You
                may have to start small, and progress gradually.
            </p>
            <p>
                To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the scripts folder, create a new
                    text document called <code>main.js</code>, and save it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In your <code>index.html</code> file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing
                    <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag: <br>
                    <code> &lt;script src="scripts/main.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is doing the same job as the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element for CSS. It applies the
                    JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else
                    on the page).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add this code to the <code>main.js</code> file: <br>
                    <code>const myHeading = document.querySelector('h1'); </code>
                    <code>myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!'; </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load <code>index.html</code> in your
                    browser.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>
                Variables
            </header>
            <p>
                Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the <code>let</code>
                keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
            </p>
            <code>let myVariable;</code>
            <p>
                A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to
                separate statements on a single line.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is case sensitive. This means <code>myVariable</code> is not the same as
                <code>myvariable</code>. If you have problems in your code, check the case!
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <header>
                Data types
            </header>
            <p>Note that variables may hold values that have different data types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    String: This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose
                    it in single quote marks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Number: This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Boolean: This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need
                    quote marks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Array: This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Object: This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.
                    Keep this in mind as you learn.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
            <header>
                Comments
            </header>
            <p>
                Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as
                comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:
            </p>
            <code>
                /* 
                Everything in between is a comment. 
                */
            </code>
            <p>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:</p>
            <code>// This is a comment</code>
